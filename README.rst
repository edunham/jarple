Jarple
======

`Hamper`_ is an IRC bot. Wouldn't it be nice to have those features, but
written in Monte? 

Monte?
------

Yes. It's a programming language. See `the docs`_ or visit us in #monte on
irc.freenode.net. 

Why the name?
-------------

It's become something of a trope in the "Monte community" (all half-dozen of
us) to name things in Lojban. I wanted to name this thing some synonym of
"carton", and ``jarple`` translates roughly to cardboard, which is
sufficiently close to "carton" since I expect we'll want ``tanxe`` ("box") for
something more directly relevant to boxes later on.
